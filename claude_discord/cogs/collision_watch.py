"""CollisionWatchCog — notice when two live sessions edit the same files.

The lounge depends on sessions announcing themselves; a session that forgets is
invisible, and those are exactly the ones that collide.  This Cog watches what
sessions actually write (recorded by ``EventProcessor`` into a
``FileActivityTracker``) and speaks up when two live threads touch the same
file.

Delivery is deliberately cheap:

* a line in the **AI Lounge**, visible in later turns when Lounge prompts are enabled
  at no token cost and with no interruption, and
* a message in **each colliding thread**, so the human watching sees it now.

It never relays into a running session — that would preempt a turn on a mere
suspicion.  Escalating is the sessions' decision, using the relay endpoint.
